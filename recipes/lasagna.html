        cooked noodles, all baked together to perfection. Whether you&rsquo;re feeding a crowd or simply indulging in a personal 
        favorite, this lasagna recipe is sure to bring joy to your holiday season.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 regular lasagna noodles (or no-boil noodles)</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Brown the Meat:</strong> In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and sausage over medium-high heat, 
            breaking the 
            meat apart with a wooden spoon. Once fully cooked, remove excess grease. (Optional) To make the meat finer, 
            pulse it in a food processor 3-4 times until broken into small pieces. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> In the same skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. 
            Add the garlic and stir for 
            30 seconds. Then, add the onion, spinach, and bell pepper. Cook until softened, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from 
            heat and pulse the mixture in the food processor until nearly pureed. Return it to the skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the Red Sauce:</strong> Add the whole peeled tomatoes to the skillet, squishing them into 
            the sauce with a spoon. Stir in the tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cover and 
            simmer for 20-30 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally. Just before using, mix in the reserved 
            crumbled beef and sausage along with the fresh basil.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> While the red sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according 
            to the package instructions for half the recommended cooking time. Drain and drizzle with a little olive 
            oil to prevent sticking. (If using no-boil noodles, you can skip this step.)</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Béchamel Sauce:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, 
            add the flour, stirring constantly for about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the milk until smooth. 
            Season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking over medium heat, whisking often, until the sauce 
            thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking 
            dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong> Start by layering the bottom of the greased pan with 3 lasagna noodles. 
            Spread a layer of red sauce over the noodles, followed by white béchamel sauce, a sprinkle of parmesan, 
            and mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers with noodles, red sauce, white sauce, and cheeses, finishing 
            with a final layer of noodles, red sauce, white sauce, and cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the lasagna for 40-50 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Let it rest for 
            at least 20 minutes before slicing, allowing the layers to set.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve your lasagna with a side of garlic bread or homemade breadsticks, a fresh green 
            salad and "Day 21" wine for a complete and satisfying meal.</li>
    </ol>
